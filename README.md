# 2-1-mp-rock-paper-scissors

## Description
Rudimentary rock, paper, scissors game which accepts R, S, and P inputs from user and compares it to values of computer to decides if user won, lost, or tied. Wins, losses, and ties are tracked and displayed after each comparison. 

## Notes
* At the moment, the game only recieves **R, S,** and **P** as inputs and terminates for any other input. 
* The game will terminate if you change tabs, as it relies on prompts, alerts, and confirmation windows to work. 

## Images of Functionality
User input is received via prompt box

Result is shown and tallied

## Code used and thought process
### Variables
```js
userVar // user input
compVar // computer input
winVar // Tracks number of wins
loseVar // Tracks number of Losses
tieVar // Tracks number of ties
optionVar = {R: {win: S, lose: P}, S: {win: P, lose: R}, P {win: R, lose: S}}; //Object with win/lose comparisons
gameRunning // 0 for game loop, 1 for game exit. 

```

### Recieving User Input
Collect Information from user and assign user input to userVar

```js
    let userVar = prompt("Would you like to play Rock(R), Paper(P), or Scissors(S)? Please type R for rock, P for paper, and S for scissors", default);
```

For more user inputs, take user input and process it such that rock/r/ROCK/etc. = R, etc.

### Generating Computer Value
For compVar Generate number from 1 to 3; 1 = R, 2 = S, 3 = P

```js
//Generates computer hand
let compHand = ["R", "P", "S"];
//Generated whole number 0,...,max
function randomInt(max) {
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * max);
}
//Shows user what computer chose
alert("Computer chose " + compVar);
//Selects number 0, 1, 2
let compVar = compHand[randomInt(3)];
const optionVar = {
    R: { win: "S", lose: "P" },
    S: { win: "P", lose: "R" },
    P: { win: "R", lose: "S" },
};
```

### Comparing userVar and compVar and displaying information about game state.
Compare information from user to information generated by computer
Display results of comparison and show number of W/L/T.
If Win, winVar++; else if lose, loseVar++, else tie++.

```js
if (optionVar[userVar].win == compVar) {
    winVar++;
    alert(
        "You win! " +
            "Your wins: " +
            winVar +
            ", your losses: " +
            loseVar +
            ", ties: " +
            tieVar
    );
} else if (optionVar[userVar].lose == compVar) {
    loseVar++;
    alert(
        "You lose! " +
            "Your wins: " +
            winVar +
            ", your losses: " +
            loseVar +
            ", ties: " +
            tieVar
    );
} else {
    tieVar++;
    alert(
        "You tied! " +
            "Your wins: " +
            winVar +
            ", your losses: " +
            loseVar +
            ", ties: " +
            tieVar
    );
}
```

Confirm window with boolean values set to false=continue, true=end loop. If gameStatus = 1, then exit message displays.

```js
//If cancel is pressed, game will continue as gameStatus remains 0.
if (!window.confirm("Press Ok to play again")) {
    gameStatus = gameStatus + 1;
}

//Exit message
if (gameStatus == 1) {
    alert("Thanks for playing!");
}
```
## To Do
* Add processing for user input so that the user can input strings such as "rock", "Rock", "r".
* Add user input validation so that wrong inputs return the user input prompt instead of terminating the game.
