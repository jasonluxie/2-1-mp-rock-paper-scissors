# 2-1-mp-rock-paper-scissors

## Drscription
Rudimentary rock, paper, scissors game which accepts R,S, and P inputs from user and compares it to values of computer to decides if user won, lost, or tied. Wins, losses, and ties are tracked and displayed after each comparison. 

## Code used and thought process

### Variables

```js
userVar // user input
compVar // randomly selects from 0 to 2
winVar // Tracks number of wins
loseVar // Tracks number of Losses
tieVar // Tracks number of ties
optionVar = {R: {win: S, lose: P}, S: {win: P, lose R}, P {win: R, lose: S}}; //Object with win/lose comparisons
gameRunning // 0 or 1 depending on confirm("Do you want to continue?")

```

### Recieving User Input

Collect Information from user and assign user input to userVar

```js
    let userVar = prompt("Would you like to play Rock(R), Paper(P), or Scissors(S)? Please type R for rock, P for paper, and S for scissors", default);
```

For more user inputs, take user input and process it such that rock/r/ROCK/etc. = R, etc.

### Generating Computer Value

For compVar Generate number from 1 to 3; 1 = R, 2 = S, 3 = P

```js
//Generates computer hand
let compHand = ["R", "P", "S"];
//Generated whole number 0,...,max
function randomInt(max) {
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * max);
}
//Selects number 0, 1, 2
let compVar = compHand[randomInt(3)];
const optionVar = {
    R: { win: "S", lose: "P" },
    S: { win: "P", lose: "R" },
    P: { win: "R", lose: "S" },
};
```

### Comparing userVar and compVar and displaying information about game state.

Compare information from user to information generated by computer
Display results of comparison and show number of W/L/T.
If Win, winVar++; else if lose, loseVar++, else tie++.

```js
if (optionVar[userVar].win == compVar) {
    winVar++;
    alert(
        "You win! " +
            "Your wins: " +
            winVar +
            ", your losses: " +
            loseVar +
            ", ties: " +
            tieVar
    );
} else if (optionVar[userVar].lose == compVar) {
    loseVar++;
    alert(
        "You lose! " +
            "Your wins: " +
            winVar +
            ", your losses: " +
            loseVar +
            ", ties: " +
            tieVar
    );
} else {
    tieVar++;
    alert(
        "You tied! " +
            "Your wins: " +
            winVar +
            ", your losses: " +
            loseVar +
            ", ties: " +
            tieVar
    );
}
```

Confirm window with boolean values set to false=continue, true=end loop. If gameStatus = 1, then exit message displays.

```js
//If cancel is pressed, game will continue as gameStatus remains 0.
if (!window.confirm("Press Ok to play again")) {
    gameStatus = gameStatus + 1;
}

//Exit message
if (gameStatus == 1) {
    alert("Thanks for playing!");
}
```
